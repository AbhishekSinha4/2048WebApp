# 2048WebApp
*My rendition of the popular 2048 game*
## Description
There are 2 JavaScript files,
* 2048.js 
* 2048Swipe.js
The 2048Swipe.js is the same as 2048.js but is also touchScreen enabled.
However, that is slghtly buggy.

The website is also dynamic, and it changes its format to accomodate everything on screen as the screen size changes.
